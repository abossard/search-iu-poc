# Refactoring ideas - IMPLEMENTED âœ…

## Completed Improvements

### âœ… Enhanced jsonOnlyMiddleware (loggerMiddleware.ts)
- **DONE**: Separated validation logic from filtering logic
- **DONE**: Filters out updates that don't conform to `isUpdate` 
- **DONE**: Filters out updates that don't have "-layout" in their "identifier" property
- **DONE**: Improved error handling and logging using pure functions

### âœ… CollectAndProcessMiddleware (collectAndProcessMiddleware.ts)
- **DONE**: Collects updates for an invocation id until "continues" is false
- **DONE**: When "continues" is false, it forwards the collected updates
- **DONE**: Implements threshold checking - if count is above threshold, processing is skipped
- **DONE**: Provides clear feedback about batching status

### âœ… Lightweight Repository Facade (invocationRepository.ts)
- **DONE**: Created in-memory repository to collect invocations and their items
- **DONE**: Efficient data structures for collection and retrieval
- **DONE**: Cleanup mechanisms for completed invocations
- **DONE**: Monitoring and debugging capabilities with statistics
- **DONE**: âœ¨ **CLEAN ARCHITECTURE**: Repository has no knowledge of webhook-specific concepts like "continues"
- **DONE**: âœ¨ **PURE DOMAIN MODEL**: Only handles invocations and updates, not protocol details

## ðŸ†• Additional Refactoring Ideas for Future Iterations

- All validation should be in a ValidationMiddleware
- All filtering should be in a FilteringMiddleware  
- types.ts isUpdate should be isItem
- types.ts validateUpdatesArray should only check if it's an array, not if it's isItem/isUpdate
